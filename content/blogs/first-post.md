## Greetings!


I'm thrilled to finally build my own portfolio site. I'll be sharing my thoughts, experiences, and projects as I keep learning along the way.

Don't hesitate to drop me a message if you have suggestions, ideas, or just want to connect. Feel free to get in touch!

## The Tiger Icon

Many thanks to [muhammad atho'](https://www.flaticon.com/authors/muhammad-atho) for the [tiger icon](https://www.flaticon.com/free-icon/tiger_6696066?related_id=9523928&origin=search) <img src="/tiger.png" alt="Tiger Icon" width="25" style="vertical-align: middle;"> available on [Flaticon](https://www.flaticon.com/).

I was born in the Year of the Tiger, and interestingly, my last name, Wang (_王_), is the very symbol often drawn on a tiger’s forehead. Using this icon feels like a playful way to say **hi**!
