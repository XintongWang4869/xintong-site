== Contributions

- Rewrote, reformat, and reorganize sections to improve the overall structure and clarity of the `README.md` file.

- Added step-by-step instructions in Quick Start section to make it more beginner-friendly.

- Fixed a broken shortcode example (`x`) by replacing it with the correct `tweet` shortcode.

See the https://github.com/gurusabarish/hugo-profile/pull/233[*pull request*, window=_blank] on GitHub for details.


== README Comparison

The original README had a flat structure with minimal sectioning. In the improved version, the content is logically organized, with clearly separated sections for setup, content management, and deployment. This makes it easier for beginners to follow.

[cols="1,2,2", options="header"]
|===
| Aspect              | Before     | After (Improved)     

| Requirements        | Brief mention of Hugo version only            | Expanded with version check command and install link   
| Getting Started     | Basic setup steps without much explanation or trouble-shootings    | Step-by-step _Quick Start_ section from site creation to local preview                      
| Content Management  | Only a few reference links      | New section on editing site content 
| Deployment          | Basic Netlify usage                            | Clear options for Netlify (template vs manual setup) and static hosting             
                  
| Tone     | Technical and brief, assumes prior knowledge  | Beginner-focused, with explanatory details
